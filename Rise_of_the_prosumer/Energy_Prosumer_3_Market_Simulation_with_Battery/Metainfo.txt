Published in: 'DEDA_class_2020SS'

Description: 'Market simulation with a battery in a microgrid, battery charging and discharging rates in a microgrid with a battery and the supply demand ratio are calculated. Energy prices are then determined using the current tariffs in Germany and energy bills are calculated using a P2P pricing mechanism. The economic profitability of the microgrid is evaluated via self-consumption rates, self-sufficiency of the grid and a comparison of costs for the participants with and without P2P trading.'

Keywords: 'energy consumption, energy production, net load, battery simulation, line graph, boxplot, pricing mechanism, economic evaluation'

Datafile:
- 100 consumer datasets (named "consumer-00000xxx.csv")
- 100 prosumer datasets (named "producer-00000xxx.csv")

Input: csv-files containing energy production data in 15-minute time interval, self-consumption of prosumers, net production of prosumers, consumption of consumers,  aggregate production and consumption, net load and battery simulation

Output: csv-files containing the interaction with the grid, the demand covered by the community grid, the battery charging power, the battery discharging power, 
the supply demand ratio, the energy selling and buying prices, the self-consumption rate of the grid, the self-sufficiency of the grid, the cost of the community energy, 
the energy bill of the consumer in a P2G model, the energy bill of the prosumer in a P2G model, the energy bill of the consumer in a P2P model, energy prices; 
the plotted self-consumption rate of the grid, the plotted self-sufficiency of the grid, the plotted energy bill of the consumer in a P2G model, the plotted energy bill of the prosumer in a P2G model,
the plotted energy bill of the consumer in a P2P model, a grid of plots for P2P energy sharing, boxplots of energy prices
